## Installing a PC

I started by unboxing all the components. This was the PC, Keyboard and Monitor. I got the PC into place and plugged all the cables I could in. I then got the stand of the monitor and put it together then attached the stand to the back of the monitor and plugged the cables in. After that I switched the PC on to make sure that there was a display.
