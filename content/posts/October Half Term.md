## 29/10/2024
Today I installed Windows Server 2022 and set it up as a Domain Controller for the classroom.

After setting up the Domain Controller I imaged one of the PC's with a custom iso made by one of my friends. After imaging the Computer I connected it up to the Domain Controller. This allowed the computer to grab the configuraion required and users from the Domain Controller. Tomorrow I will finish imaging all PC's and I will connect them all to the Domain Controller.
